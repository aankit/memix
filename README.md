#Memix: Mix your memories to create new ones

##How to use
On the command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aankit/memix
$ cd memix
$ mv your/image/folder/allImages path/to/memix/memorial
```

Make sure to check the requirements.txt file and install the modules.


##Set up the cron job
You probably don't want the cron to run that often, maybe once a week or month. It depends on how fast you want to replace your old memories with new ones.

Lots of tutorials on line to setup a cron job. I like this [one](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-add-jobs-to-cron-under-linux-or-unix-oses/). 

You may also want some basic VIM learning. See if you like this [one](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial).
